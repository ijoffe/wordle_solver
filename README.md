## General Information
This repository contains code to solve the popular game Wordle. Some folders in this repository contain previous iterations of the algorihtm, but the best and most recent implmentation is contained in the main directory. All code was created by me, Isaac Joffe, in February of 2022.

## Description
The aim of this project is to create an algorithm that can successfully find the correct word in the game Wordle within the given number of attempts in all cases. This repository contains an algorithm that can successfully determine all words, and mostly in enough attempts.

## Background
Wordle is a widely popular puzzle game similar to the common board game Mastermind. The game involves using six guesses to try to determine a daily secret word. More information about the game's history and mechanics can be found at the following link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordle. The game can be played at the following link: https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html.

When Wordle rapidly became very popluar in late 2021 and early 2022, I often struggled to correctly and efficiently solve the puzzles compared to my friends and family. After continually getting lower scores, I decided to create an algorithm that could beat most people at the game.

## Technologies
All code contained is written in Python 3.8.10. I created all the code and files in this repository using my personal virtual machine, which runs the Ubuntu distribution of the Linux operating system, through the Sublime Text text editor and the Linux terminal window.

## Instructions
Currently, the program can only be used directly through a terminal window. Now, begin entering the suggested words into the Wordle website and enter the result that wordle gives ('b' for a black/white letter, 'y' for a yellow letter, and 'g' for a green letter) in the order given into the terminal until the program guesses the correct word.

## Example Usage
